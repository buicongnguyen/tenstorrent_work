!!! info "What ‘seed’ means"
    The official report and its assets are preserved verbatim under
    <code>upstream/tt-metal/tech_reports/prog_examples/pad_multi_core/pad_multi_core.md</code>. This learner page
    establishes provenance, a reading map, and an improvement plan; its technical
    explanation is still queued for a full visual rewrite.

## Original report map

| Signal | Pinned-source value |
|---|---:|
| Lines | 354 |
| Section headings | 5 |
| Fenced code examples | 17 |

### Section outline

- Building and Running the Example
- Device setup
- Initialize data
- Designate cores for utilization
- Configure and create DRAM buffers

## Improvement plan

The learner edition should make these parts explicit before it can move beyond
`seed`:

1. State the problem and the hardware/software boundary involved.
2. Draw the data or control flow, including ownership and synchronization.
3. Extract correctness invariants and architecture-specific assumptions.
4. Connect the concepts to concrete TT-Metal symbols or examples.
5. Add a small verification exercise with an expected observation.

## Code connection

Code references remain in the [pinned official report](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/992f3ca634aac8733c70e48da395aab5361b4166/tech_reports/prog_examples/pad_multi_core/pad_multi_core.md). During
the full rewrite, each important symbol will be mapped to its role in the
host → data-movement → compute → data-movement path.
